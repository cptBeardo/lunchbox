This is my first un-guided project through Boot.dev.  The initial purpose of this
project will be to keep inventory of food in the house and to create a menu
of items that I would like to make for different meals during the week.

In addition, it will keep track of staples that need to be replenished, as well as
taking recipes that we would like to make on a given night and create a shopping list
based on both.
